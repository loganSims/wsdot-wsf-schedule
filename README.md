#WSDOT WSF Schedule

The WSF Schedule code is an example of how to query the Washington State Ferries schedule web service. The returned results are dumped to both an umcompressed and compressed JSON file. The program is currently used to package the ferry schedule data which is used in our Android and iPhone mobile apps. We are publishing it in hopes that others might find it useful and be able to learn from it.
